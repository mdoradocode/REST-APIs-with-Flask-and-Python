#*What is a web server
    ##Some say it is a piece of hardware
    ##A piece of software designed to accept incoming web requests
    ##Google has many servers, when we go to that website, we reach out to a server, we ask for something to be returned
        ##We send the following GET / HTTP/1.1
        ##                      Host: www.google.com
    ## "GET" is the verb
    ## "/" is the path
    ## "HTTP" is the protocol
    ## Servers will interpret the GET request many different ways
    ##Difference in response depends on the server
    ##GET: Retrieve something :: EX GET /item/1
    ##POST: Receieve data and use it :: POST/item
    ##PUT: Make sure something is there :: PUT /item
    ##DELETE: Remove soemthing DELETE /item/1
    ##There are many more commands
